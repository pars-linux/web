Repository Concepts
===================

Pardus has generally two different types of repository: source code repository and
software repository.

Software Repository (binary or package repository)
--------------------------------------------------

A software repository generally means a storage location from which software
packages may be retrieved and installed on a computer. Therefore compiled
Pardus packages are located at software repositories in binary format.
